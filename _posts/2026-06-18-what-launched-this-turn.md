[Part 3 of this series](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-11-inside-the-subagent-trace-file.md) opened the subagent trace file and, in passing, named a family of fields it didn't stop to unpack: `attributionAgent`, `attributionMcpServer`, `attributionMcpTool`, `attributionSkill`. It called them markers that tell you that you've crossed into a sidechain and moved on. The post's job was the file split, not provenance.

This is the aside that picks them up. It's short and standalone: one field family, what each member records, and the one trap to look out for.

Here's the whole idea in a sentence. **Every `assistant` line can carry a record of how it came to exist** — which subagent it ran as, which MCP tool it routed through, which Skill it ran under — and that record sits at the top level of the line, queryable without ever descending into `message.content`.

---

## Provenance, not content

Part 2 made a point of the [`snake_case` / `camelCase` split](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-04-reading-a-claude-code-session-line-by-line.md): `message.content` is Anthropic API payload (`snake_case`), and the fields Claude Code wraps around it are harness bookkeeping (`camelCase`). The `attribution*` family is squarely the second kind. These fields aren't part of what the model said. They're Claude Code's annotation of how this turn was routed, recorded alongside the message rather than inside it.

That's a question the content can't answer about itself. A `tool_use` block knows it's calling `mcp__github__get_issue`; it doesn't know it's doing so as the `pm` subagent, three levels removed from your prompt. The attribution fields carry that context at the top level of the line.

There are three kinds of provenance here, across four fields:

| Field                                         | What it records                                | Example value              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `attributionAgent`                            | The subagent _type_ this turn ran as           | `"pm"`                     |
| `attributionMcpServer` / `attributionMcpTool` | The MCP server + tool this turn routed through | `"github"` / `"get_issue"` |
| `attributionSkill`                            | The invoked Skill this turn ran under          | a Skill name               |

Each has a **strict per-line-type presence pattern**, documented in full in [`reference/subagent-traces.md`](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/reference/subagent-traces.md#attribution-fields): all four appear on `assistant` lines only, never on `user` or `attachment` lines. So a parser can branch on `type == "assistant"` first and only look for these there.

The worked examples below run against the synthetic [`anatomy-subagent-trace.jsonl`](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/fixtures/synthetic/anatomy-subagent-trace.jsonl) fixture — a sixteen-line `pm` subagent run that reads an issue and posts two comments. It's valid JSONL, so the `jq` snippets execute against it directly.

---

## `attributionAgent` — which agent ran

This is the one most people reach for first, and the most reliable. Every `assistant` line inside a subagent trace carries `attributionAgent`, set to the subagent type that ran — `"pm"`, `"general-purpose"`, a custom agent name. The value is the same string the parent recorded as `toolUseResult.agentType`, and the same one you passed as `subagent_type` in the `Agent` call. One run, one agent type, stamped on every model turn it took.

```bash
# Which agent produced each assistant turn?
jq -r 'select(.type == "assistant") | .attributionAgent // "(main loop)"' \
  anatomy-subagent-trace.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
#   8 pm
```

All eight `assistant` lines come back `pm` — the fixture is a single `pm` invocation. The `// "(main loop)"` fallback is doing nothing here, but it matters the moment you point this at a parent session: there, `attributionAgent` is **absent**, and every main-loop turn falls through to `(main loop)`. That contrast is the field's whole value — it partitions turns by which agent produced them, with the main loop as the implicit "no agent" bucket.

One caveat to carry into the next section: the observational scan behind the reference doc found `attributionAgent` on sidechain assistant lines **only** (10,291 sidechain, 0 main). So in practice its presence _does_ track subagent-ness. That's a property of how it's emitted, though — not a license to use it as your subagent test. More on why in a moment.

---

## `attributionMcpServer` / `attributionMcpTool` — which MCP tool

These two travel together — present as a pair or absent as a pair — and they appear only on `assistant` turns that interact with an [MCP](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/reference/subagent-traces.md#when-attributionmcpserverattributionmcptool-appear)-defined tool. Our `pm` run calls `mcp__github__get_issue` once and `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` twice — three MCP turns out of eight — and exactly those three lines carry the pair:

```bash
# Which MCP server/tool did the MCP turns route through?
jq -r 'select(.type == "assistant" and has("attributionMcpServer"))
  | "\(.attributionMcpServer)__\(.attributionMcpTool)"' \
  anatomy-subagent-trace.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
#   2 github__add_issue_comment
#   1 github__get_issue
```

The other five `assistant` lines — the `Read`s and the final summary — **omit both keys entirely**. They aren't set to empty strings; the keys simply aren't on the line. So `has("attributionMcpServer")` is the right test, not a truthiness check on the value.

What the pair gives you that the `tool_use` block doesn't is a _decoded_ form, pre-split at the top level. The call itself carries `name: "mcp__github__get_issue"` buried in `message.content`; the attribution pair lifts the `github` server and the `get_issue` tool out to the line's surface, so you can group turns by server or by tool without parsing the `__`-delimited name or walking into the content array.

One honest gap: the **exact** trigger condition is [still being verified](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/reference/subagent-traces.md#open-verification-items). Whether the pair lands on the assistant line that _emits_ the MCP `tool_use`, only on the turn that _follows_ an MCP `tool_result`, or on both, isn't yet disambiguated — roughly half the assistant lines in a given MCP flow carry it. Treat it as "MCP-routing context is present when this turn touches an MCP server," and don't assume one-to-one with `tool_use` emission until that's nailed down.

---

## `attributionSkill` — and the trap

The fourth field is the same shape as the others — present on `assistant` lines, naming the invoked Skill a turn ran under — with one difference that changes how you can use it.

**`attributionSkill` is not a sidechain signal.** Skills run in the main loop, not just inside subagents, so the field shows up in _parent_ sessions too. The scan behind the reference doc found it on both sides of the line: 4,785 sidechain assistant lines and 1,895 main-session ones. Compare that to `attributionAgent`'s clean 10,291 / 0 split, and the difference is the whole point — `attributionAgent` happens to be subagent-exclusive; `attributionSkill` is not.

Here's the trap that sits underneath this, and it's worth stating plainly because it's an easy reflex:

> Don't decide "is this a subagent line?" by checking whether an `attribution*` field is present.

It seems reasonable — the fields cluster in trace files, so "has an attribution field" feels like "is a subagent line." But it's wrong two ways. `attributionSkill` appears on main-loop turns whenever a Skill is active, and the `attributionMcp*` pair appears on main-loop turns whenever an MCP tool is used outside a subagent. Branch on either and you'll tag ordinary main-session turns as subagent work.

The field that actually answers the question is `isSidechain` — the [canonical, content-free signal](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/reference/subagent-traces.md#the-issidechain-marker) Part 3 built its case around. The division of labor is clean once you see it: **the attribution fields tell you _how_ a turn was launched; `isSidechain` tells you _where_ it lives.** Provenance and location are different questions, and only one of them is a subagent test.

---

## What provenance buys you

Because all of this sits at the top level of the line, you can attribute behavior — and cost — by origin without ever reparsing `message.content`. Each of these is a single top-level field filter:

- **Per agent.** Group `assistant` turns (or their `message.usage`) by `attributionAgent` to see which subagent type ran up the most turns or tokens. Part 4 is where the token side of this gets its full treatment — but the _grouping key_ is this field.
- **Per MCP tool.** Tally `attributionMcpServer` / `attributionMcpTool` to see which servers and tools a session leans on, and which subagents lean on them.
- **Per Skill.** Filter on `attributionSkill` to find every turn a Skill touched — across both the main loop and subagents, which is exactly the reach that makes it _not_ a sidechain signal but _does_ make it a complete Skill-usage view.

None of these needs the content array. That's the practical payoff of provenance living in the harness bookkeeping layer rather than inside the model's message.

---

## Try it on your own sessions

Point the agent grouping at a real session and its traces together. Main-loop turns fall into `(main loop)`; subagent turns report their agent type:

```bash
# Which agent produced each assistant turn, across a session AND its traces:
jq -r 'select(.type == "assistant") | .attributionAgent // "(main loop)"' \
  ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-uuid>.jsonl \
  ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-uuid>/subagents/*.jsonl \
  | sort | uniq -c
```

If you've run anything under a Skill recently, this next one makes the "not a sidechain signal" point concrete on your own data — you'll see `attributionSkill` values coming from the parent session file, not just the trace files:

```bash
# Every Skill-attributed turn, with which file it came from:
for f in ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-uuid>.jsonl \
         ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-uuid>/subagents/*.jsonl; do
  jq -r --arg f "$(basename "$f")" \
    'select(.type == "assistant" and has("attributionSkill"))
     | "\($f)\t\(.attributionSkill)"' "$f"
done
```

Both use defensive `?`-free `select` guards on `type`, so non-matching lines are skipped rather than raising — the same discipline from Part 2's snippets. They assume `jq` on bash or zsh.

## What's next

This aside doesn't change the through-line: Part 3 still hands off to [Part 4 — "Token accounting is harder than it looks"](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/.claude/specs/series-outline.md). If anything it sets the table for it. Once you can compute what a session cost, the natural next question is _whose_ cost — which agent, which tool, which Skill ran up the bill. The attribution fields are the grouping keys for that slice; Part 4 is the arithmetic.

This is verified against **Claude Code v2.1.150**, the same baseline as Part 3. The attribution family is exactly the kind of harness bookkeeping that evolves independently of the API message format, so if your own sessions show an attribution field — or a trigger condition — I haven't described, especially from the Agent SDK, that's the kind of thing that updates the [reference doc](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/reference/subagent-traces.md) and sharpens later posts.
