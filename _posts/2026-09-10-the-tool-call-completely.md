The model behind Claude Code cannot touch your machine. It reads text and it writes text. Think of it as a brain with no hands. Tools are the hands, and the eyes too: reading a file is as much a tool call as writing one. Every file it opens, every command it runs, every edit that lands in your repo happens because Claude Code, the harness wrapped around the model, interpreted a block of the model's written text as a tool request and carried it out. Tool calls are the seam where a language model stops being a conversation and starts being an agent, and in a session file they are the only place where something happened to your machine.

The cycle is simpler than it looks. The model writes a `tool_use` block naming a tool and its arguments, then stops, and the API records why it stopped: `stop_reason: "tool_use"`. Nothing has run yet. Claude Code takes it from there. It checks whether that call is approved (the permission prompt lives in this gap), runs the tool, packs the output into a `tool_result` block, and sends the whole conversation back for another turn. On disk that is two lines: the ask on an `assistant` line, the answer on the next `user` line, tied together by one id. That loop is the most common event in a session file. Across my own sessions, an assistant line ends in `stop_reason: "tool_use"` about fourteen times for every one that ends in `end_turn`.

So the pair is worth knowing in detail. [Part 2](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-04-reading-a-claude-code-session-line-by-line.md) introduced the cycle and moved on, calling `toolUseResult` "where most of the high-information signal lives." [Part 4](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-24-token-accounting-is-harder-than-it-looks.md) closed by asking what all those tool calls were actually doing, once you know what they cost. This post answers both: how the two-line cycle works, the pairing key and what a missing pair means, and what a representative set of tools leaves behind in the envelope.

One more thing came out of writing this post. I re-checked every claim here against every session file on my own disk. That scan covered 2,480 files and 289,773 lines, spanning Claude Code v2.1.5 through v2.1.243, and read key names and counts only, never message content. Three claims my own [reference doc](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/reference/tool-invocation.md) had been making turned out to be wrong. The doc listed a `Bash` field that does not exist, described the `Read` envelope as flat when it is nested, and gave a way of spotting parallel tool calls that finds four of them in a corpus holding more than nine thousand. All three are fixed in the doc now, and all three appear below, worked into the walkthrough rather than collected in an appendix.

Everything below traces back to [`reference/tool-invocation.md`](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/reference/tool-invocation.md), corrected where the scan disagreed with it, plus the two synthetic fixtures the series has used since Part 1: [`anatomy-tool-use-cycle.jsonl`](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/fixtures/synthetic/anatomy-tool-use-cycle.jsonl) and [`anatomy-agent-invocation.jsonl`](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/fixtures/synthetic/anatomy-agent-invocation.jsonl).

## The two-line cycle

Every tool call Claude Code makes gets recorded as a pair: a `tool_use` content block on an `assistant` line, matched to a `tool_result` content block on a later `user` line. The pairing key is `tool_use_id`, and the pair is the smallest semantically complete unit of agent activity the format has. A `tool_use` block alone tells you what Claude intended. A `tool_result` block alone tells you what came back, with no idea what was asked. Only the pair tells you what happened, and the pairing is by id, not by adjacency.

```jsonl
// from https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/fixtures/synthetic/anatomy-tool-use-cycle.jsonl
{"type":"user","sessionId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002","uuid":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111112001","parentUuid":null,"isSidechain":false,"cwd":"/home/dev/example-project","version":"2.1.150","timestamp":"2026-05-21T09:15:00.000Z","message":{"role":"user","content":"What's in src/main.py?"}}
{"type":"assistant","sessionId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002","uuid":"22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222002","parentUuid":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111112001","isSidechain":false,"cwd":"/home/dev/example-project","version":"2.1.150","timestamp":"2026-05-21T09:15:01.100Z","message":{"role":"assistant","model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","content":[{"type":"text","text":"I'll read the file."},{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_synthetic_001","name":"Read","input":{"file_path":"/home/dev/example-project/src/main.py"}}],"usage":{"input_tokens":18,"output_tokens":35,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1240},"stop_reason":"tool_use"}}
{"type":"user","sessionId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002","uuid":"33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333332001","parentUuid":"22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222002","isSidechain":false,"cwd":"/home/dev/example-project","version":"2.1.150","timestamp":"2026-05-21T09:15:01.450Z","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"tool_result","tool_use_id":"toolu_synthetic_001","content":"def main():\n    print('Hello, world!')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n"}]}}
```

Three lines. Line 1 is a plain user prompt, the string shape of `message.content`. Line 2 is the assistant turn: a `text` block, then the `tool_use` block with `id: toolu_synthetic_001`, closing with `stop_reason: "tool_use"`. Line 3 is the `tool_result`, `tool_use_id` matching the `id` from line 2, `message.content` now the array shape instead of the string one. No `toolUseResult` key at all here. `Read` is light enough that it often doesn't need one; more on that below.

`stop_reason` is the forward-looking half of the pair. Two values dominate a real session: `tool_use`, meaning the model paused to call something and a `tool_result` is coming, and `end_turn`, meaning it actually finished. Coming, but not necessarily on the next line: block splitting and parallel calls both put other lines in between, which is why the pairing is by `tool_use_id` and never by position. A third, `stop_sequence`, shows up far more rarely. The exact split across the scan was 93,832 to 6,724 to 212, which is where the intro's fourteen-to-one comes from. Three values is what my disk holds, not what the format defines. The Messages API also specifies `max_tokens`, `pause_turn`, and `refusal`, and that list has grown over time, so read `stop_reason` as an open enum rather than a three-way switch.

The two shapes of `message.content` on `user` lines, Part 2's structural twist, show up lopsided in the same direction, though not in the same ratio: 68,963 list-shaped against 7,441 string-shaped in the same scan, a little over nine to one. Seeing the array shape on a `user` line is itself a tell, before you look inside it, that a tool cycle just closed.

The fixture above packs a `text` block and a `tool_use` block into the same line's content array, which is legal and does happen. It's also, per the same scan, nearly extinct: 14 multi-block lines out of 289,773. Current Claude Code versions write one JSONL line per content block far more often than not. The consequences for anything that tries to detect parallel tool calls get their own section below.

## The pairing key, and what a missing pair means

`tool_use_id` is unique within a session, not globally. Two different session files can independently mint the same ID, so anything aggregating across sessions has to key on `sessionId` first. Subagent traces mint their own `tool_use_id`s too, in their own space. The parent file only ever shows the `Agent` tool's own pair plus its rollup, never the subagent's internal calls. ([Part 3](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-11-inside-the-subagent-trace-file.md) is the trace-file lens; more on that split below.)

The rule of thumb: every `tool_use` should have exactly one matching `tool_result` in the same file, and a missing one almost always means an interrupted session, the cycle never closed before the file stopped growing. The scan mostly confirms that in the direction you'd expect, and also turned up the mirror case: 102 `tool_result` blocks with no matching `tool_use` anywhere in the same file, 98 in parent sessions and 4 inside subagent traces. That's rare, and the same mechanism explains it from the other side: a session resumed or a trace picked up mid-pair, with the block that would complete it sitting in a different file.

## What `toolUseResult` carries, tool by tool

Two structural rules hold across every tool. `toolUseResult` sits at the line's top level, beside `message`, not inside it, and it's camelCase where the content blocks around it are snake_case. Not every tool populates it: lightweight tools can omit it entirely, and the content a parser needs is still sitting in `tool_result.content`.

A third rule the reference doc didn't carry until this scan: `toolUseResult` is sometimes a bare string instead of an object. The scan found it on `Bash` (1,075 times), `Read` (607), `Edit` (240), `Write` (139), `WebFetch` (20), and `Grep` (14). Code that reaches straight for `toolUseResult.stdout` will error, or worse, silently return null, on every one of those lines. Check the type before you check the key.

**`Read`** looks like the lightest envelope, and the reference doc had its shape wrong. The doc listed `bytes`, `content`, and `isImage` as top-level keys. At the top level there are exactly two: `type` and `file`. Everything else is nested one level down inside `file`, where the scan found `filePath` on 8,155 results, and `content`, `numLines`, `startLine`, and `totalLines` on 8,152 apiece. There is no `bytes` key anywhere, and no `isImage` either. An image read is signaled instead by `file.base64` and `file.type` (110 results each) plus `file.dimensions` (100), and a read that hit the token cap sets `file.truncatedByTokenCap` (43).

The nesting is the part worth using. `startLine`, `numLines`, and `totalLines` together tell you Claude read a slice rather than a whole file, and how much of the file it never saw. Flatten the envelope and that distinction disappears. `Read` also skips the envelope entirely about a third of the time: present on 8,866 of 13,589 results, absent on the remaining 4,723, with the content still sitting in `tool_result.content` either way.

**`Bash`** carries the richest envelope, though not the one the reference doc described. The doc listed a `code` field, an exit code, as one of three signals worth reading. That field does not exist: the scan found zero `code` keys across 30,427 `Bash` envelopes spanning the 103 Claude Code versions that produced them, and zero `durationMs` or `durationSeconds` either. The real envelope, stable since v2.1.9, is `stdout`, `stderr`, `interrupted`, and `isImage`, joined by `noOutputExpected` from v2.1.71 on. A handful of conditional keys round it out depending on what the command actually did: `returnCodeInterpretation` (the nearest thing to an exit-code signal, present on only 207 of those results), `gitOperation` (963, when the command touched git), `persistedOutputPath` and `persistedOutputSize` (162, when the output was too large to keep inline and got spilled to a file on disk instead), and `backgroundTaskId` (152, for commands launched with `run_in_background`). So the diagnosis still runs through `interrupted`, `stderr`, and the result content, with no exit code anywhere in it.

**`Edit`** carries the diff. It contains `structuredPatch` on 7,099 of 7,182 results in the scan, alongside `filePath`, `oldString`, `newString`, `originalFile`, `userModified`, and `replaceAll`. Anything auditing what Claude actually changed in a file reads off `structuredPatch`; the rest of the keys are provenance.

### Agent: the parent-side lens

Everything in this section is what the _parent_ session records about a subagent run, not a tour of the subagent's own trace file. [Part 3](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-11-inside-the-subagent-trace-file.md) already covered that ground, including `isSidechain`, the trace's own `tool_use_id` space, and the per-turn `message.usage` inside `subagents/agent-<agentId>.jsonl`. What follows is only what's visible without ever opening that file.

Here's the `toolUseResult` object from [`anatomy-agent-invocation.jsonl`](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/fixtures/synthetic/anatomy-agent-invocation.jsonl), the same fixture Parts 1, 3, and 4 have all used:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Read issue #5 and draft acceptance criteria for each open item.",
  "agentId": "99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999001",
  "agentType": "pm",
  "totalDurationMs": 132140,
  "totalTokens": 28803,
  "totalToolUseCount": 7,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 3,
    "output_tokens": 300,
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": 1500,
    "cache_read_input_tokens": 27000
  },
  "toolStats": {
    "readCount": 4,
    "searchCount": 0,
    "bashCount": 0,
    "editFileCount": 0,
    "linesAdded": 0,
    "linesRemoved": 0,
    "otherToolCount": 3
  }
}
```

`prompt` echoes exactly what the parent asked for, word for word, so you can read task intent without re-walking the assistant line that issued it. `toolStats` gives a coarse shape of what happened, keyed by category (`readCount`, `searchCount`, `bashCount`, `editFileCount`, `otherToolCount`, plus `linesAdded`/`linesRemoved`), never by tool name. In the scan, `prompt` showed up on 1,472 `Agent` results and `toolStats` on 1,029; both are common but conditional, not guaranteed on every invocation.

`totalTokens` and `usage` are the field pair [Part 4](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-24-token-accounting-is-harder-than-it-looks.md) spent a whole post on: a single-turn snapshot, not a run total, good for a rough context-size read and nothing else. `totalDurationMs` and `totalToolUseCount` are the two true run-level rollups here, and `totalToolUseCount` counts the subagent's own direct calls, not any made by a subagent it spawned in turn. `agentId` is the handle to the trace file; `agentType` is which subagent ran. That's the whole parent-side picture: enough to know what was asked, roughly what kind of work happened, and where to go for more.

## Errors that still have something to say

`is_error` lives on the `tool_result` block, a boolean, absent on the happy path. It doesn't tell you whether the content next to it is worth reading. `Bash` is the canonical case: a command exits non-zero, `stderr` fills with a real diagnostic the model can act on, and `stdout` still holds whatever ran before the failure.

Of 2,300 `tool_result` blocks flagged `is_error: true`, all 2,300 carried content. A parser that discards the payload when `is_error` is true throws away something useful on every error in the corpus.

A session can also end mid-cycle: an `assistant` line's `tool_use` with no `tool_result` anywhere after it. That's the missing-pair case from the pairing-key section, an interrupted session rather than a failed tool.

## When one turn fires several tools

Parallel tool calls are common in real sessions, and until this post's scan `reference/tool-invocation.md` had the detection wrong. The doc said a parallel turn looks like one `assistant` line carrying multiple `tool_use` blocks in its `message.content` array, and gave a `jq` one-liner that counts blocks per line. I ran that exact snippet against the scan corpus while writing this post. It found 4 parallel turns, out of 68,395 lines carrying a `tool_use` block. That's not a believable rate for a coding agent, so I went looking for why.

The cause is the block-splitting behavior from the two-line-cycle section. Claude Code, in current versions, writes one JSONL line per content block far more often than one line per turn. The blocks that belong to a single model turn, multiple `tool_use` calls included, share a `requestId` (and a `message.id`), not a line. Group by `requestId` instead of counting within a line, and the real picture shows up: 55,008 requests in the corpus carried at least one `tool_use` block. 45,751 of them, 83.2%, were serial, meaning exactly one tool call. 9,257, 16.8%, were parallel: two or more tool calls, with the largest single request firing 22 tools at once.

The corrected detection groups by request, and this is what the doc carries now:

```bash
jq -s '
  [.[]
   | select(.type == "assistant" and (.isSidechain? // false) == false)
   | select((.requestId? // .message.id?) != null)]
  | group_by(.requestId? // .message.id?)
  | map({
      request_id: (.[0].requestId? // .[0].message.id?),
      tool_use_count: ([.[] | .message.content[]? | select(.type == "tool_use")] | length)
    })
  | map(select(.tool_use_count > 1))
' "$F"
```

The second `select` is doing real work. Drop it and every line carrying neither `requestId` nor `message.id` collapses into one `null` bucket, which `group_by` then reports as a single enormous parallel request built out of unrelated serial turns.

The wall-clock consequence stands either way, and the reference doc had that part right. A serial sequence of three `Read` calls takes roughly three times as long as one; a parallel batch of three takes roughly as long as one. Both show up as `readCount: 3` in a subagent's `toolStats`, which cannot tell them apart. Grouping by `requestId` is what tells you which kind of turn you're looking at.

## Reading it back out

Two more `jq` recipes, both already in [`reference/tool-invocation.md`](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/reference/tool-invocation.md) and both correct as documented.

The first builds a tool-name histogram for a whole session, everything Claude reached for, most-used first:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.type == "assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type == "tool_use") | .name' "$F" \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

The second pulls the rollup off every `Agent` invocation in a session, for a coarse read on delegation shape without opening a single trace file:

```bash
jq 'select(.toolUseResult?.toolStats?) | .toolUseResult.toolStats' "$F"
```

Both use the defensive `?` operator, on `.message.content[]?` and on `.toolUseResult?`, because real sessions carry lines where those keys are arrays, strings, or absent entirely. The bare-string `toolUseResult` from earlier is the case the second snippet's guard exists for. Without the guards, `jq` writes an error to stderr for each offending line, `Cannot iterate over string` from the first snippet and `Cannot index string with string` from the second, processes the rest, and still exits 0. You get a partial answer next to a stream of errors rather than a clean one, which is easy to miss in a pipeline.

One caveat carried over from Part 2: `tool_use.name` and `toolStats` don't join. The histogram counts exact tool names; the rollup counts categories. To separate what the parent did from what a subagent did, by tool, you still have to open the subagent's own trace file and run the histogram query against that.

## What this post leaves out

I left three things out on purpose. What a subagent's `toolUseResult` looks like from inside its own trace file, as opposed to the parent-side rollup covered above, is [Part 3](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-11-inside-the-subagent-trace-file.md)'s territory, not this post's. What any of this actually costs, in tokens or dollars, is [Part 4](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-24-token-accounting-is-harder-than-it-looks.md)'s. And tool-call retry rate, which uses this same `tool_use_id` pairing and the `is_error` flag to ask a different question, already shipped as its own aside: [How often does Claude retry a tool call?](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/blob/main/posts/2026-06-08-how-often-does-claude-retry-a-tool-call.md)

## What's next

Session data records what Claude Code did. Hooks (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`) fire while it's working, outside the model loop entirely. The next post goes looking for whatever a hook leaves behind in the JSONL once it's fired: what's there, what's conditional, and what's not in the file at all.

The corrections landed via [issue #210](https://github.com/frederick-douglas-pearce/claude-code-sessions/issues/210), which also documents the block-splitting behavior underneath the parallel-detection error and the `tool-results/` spill mechanism.
